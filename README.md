# Quicksilver Utilities

Unofficial packages to help build complex
applications using [quicksilver](https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver).

N.B. this project is still moving fast. I typically check it out
as a submodule as part of a larger project, and use a Cargo workspace
in that larger project (hence the lack of a Cargo lock file and
workspace Cargo.toml in the root of this repository).
